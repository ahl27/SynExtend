Distance Matrix Predictions for ProtWeaver
}
\description{
\code{ProtWeaver} incorporates four classes of prediction, each with multiple 
methods and algorithms. Distance Matrix (DM) methods examine conservation 
of overall evolutionary rates within orthology groups using distance matrices
constructed from each gene tree.

\code{predict.ProtWeaver} currently supports three DM methods:
\itemize{
  \item \code{'MirrorTree'}
  \item \code{'ContextTree'}
  \item \code{'TreeDistance'}
}
}

\details{
All distance matrix methods require a \code{ProtWeaver} object initialized
with \code{dendrogram} objects. See \code{\link{ProtWeaver}} for more information on input data types.

The \code{MirrorTree} method was introduced by Pazos et al. (2001). This method
builds distance matrices using a nucleotide substitution model, and then
calculates coevolution between gene families using the Pearson correlation 
coefficient of the upper triangle of the two corresponding matrices. 

Experimental analysis has shown data in the upper triangle is heavily
redundant and rapidly overwhelms available system memory. Previous work
has incorporated dimensionality reduction such as SVD to reduce the dimensionality
of the data, but this prevents parallelization of the data and doesn't solve memory
issues (since SVD takes as input the entire matrix with columns corresponding to upper triangle values). \code{ProtWeaver} instead uses a seeded random projection
following Achlioptas (2001) to reduce the dimensionality of the data in a 
reproducible and parallel-compatible way. We also utilize Spearman's \eqn{\rho},
which has demonstrated better performance than Pearson's \eqn{r}.

Subsequent work by Pazos et al. (2005) and Sato et al. (2005, 2006) found
multiple ways to improve predictions from the initial \code{MirrorTree} method.
These methods incorporate additional phylogenetic context, and are thus
called \code{ContextTree} methods. These improvements include correcting
for overall evolutionary rate using a species tree and/or using projection vectors.
The built-in \code{ContextTree} method implements these corrections, which can perform
better on sets of genomes with high similarity (low evolutionary divergence). 
Note that the projection vector correction is not compatible with parallel implementation.

The \code{TreeDistance} method uses phylogenetic tree distance to quantify differences between gene trees. This method implements a number of metrics and groups them together to improve overall runtime. Individual methods can be specified using the \code{TreeMethods} argument, which expects a character vector containing one or more of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"CI"}: \link[=CIDist]{Clustering Information Distance}
\item \code{"RF"}: \link[=RFDist]{Robinson-Foulds Distance}
\item \code{"JRF"}: \link[=JRFDist]{Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds Distance}
\item \code{"Nye"}: \link[=JRFDist]{Nye Similarity}
\item \code{"KF"}: \link[=KFDist]{Kuhner-Felsenstein Distance}
\item \code{"all"}: All of the above methods
}

See the links above for more information and references. All of these metrics are accessible using the \code{\link{PhyloDistance}} method. Method \code{"JRF"} defaults to a \code{k}
value of 4, but this can be specified further if necessary using the \code{JRFk} input parameter. Higher values of \code{k} approach the value of Robinson-Foulds 
distance, but these have a negligible impact on performance so use of the default parameter is encouraged for simplicity.
