\title{
Distance Matrix Predictions for ProtWeaver
}
\description{
\code{ProtWeaver} incorporates four classes of prediction, each with multiple 
methods and algorithms. Distance Matrix (DM) methods examine conservation 
of overall evolutionary rates within orthology groups using distance matrices
constructed from each gene tree.

\code{predict.ProtWeaver} currently supports three DM methods:
\itemize{
  \item \code{'MirrorTree'}
  \item \code{'ContextTree'}
  \item \code{'GenRF'}
}
}

\details{
All distance matrix methods require a \code{ProtWeaver} object initialized
with \code{dendrogram} objects. See \code{\link{ProtWeaver}} for more information on input data types.

The \code{MirrorTree} method was introduced by Pazos et al. (2001). This method
builds distance matrices using a nucleotide substitution model, and then
calculates coevolution between gene families using the Pearson correlation 
coefficient of the upper triangle of the two corresponding matrices.

Subsequent work by Pazos et al. (2005) and Sato et al. (2005, 2006) found
multiple ways to improve predictions from the initial \code{MirrorTree} method.
These methods incorporate additional phylogenetic context, and are thus
called \code{ContextTree} methods. These improvements include correcting
for overall evolutionary rate using a species tree or projection vectors, using partial correlation coefficient instead of Pearson correlation, and/or 
normalizing distances prior to calculation. The built-in \code{ContextTree}
method uses corrections based on what is possible with provided input data.

The \code{GenRF} method uses information-theoretic Generalized Robinson-Foulds
distance to quantify distance between gene trees. See \code{\link{GeneralizedRF}}
for more information.
