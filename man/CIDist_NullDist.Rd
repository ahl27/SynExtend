\title{
Simulated Null Distributions for CI Distance
}
\description{
Simulated values of \link[=PhyloDistance-CI]{Clustering Information Distance} for random trees with 4 to 200 shared leaves.
}
\usage{data("CIDist_NullDist")}
\value{
  A matrix \code{CI_DISTANCE_INTERNAL} with 197 columns and 13 rows.
}
\details{
Each column of the matrix corresponds to the distribution of distances between random trees with the given number of leaves. This begins at \code{CI_DISTANCE_INTERNAL[,1]} corresponding to 4 leaves, and ends at \code{CI_DISTANCE_INTERNAL[,197]} corresponding to 200 leaves. Distances begin at 4 leaves since there is only one unrooted tree with 1, 2, or 3 leaves (so the distance between any given tree with less than 4 leaves is always 0).

Each row of the matrix corresponds to statistics for the given simulation set. The first row gives the minimum value, the next 9 give quantiles in \code{c(1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 90\%, 95\%, 99\%)}, and the last three rows give the \code{max}, \code{mean}, and \code{sd} (resp.).
