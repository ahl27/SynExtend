Initial Verison - generate ortholog predictions from combining synteny maps built by the R package DECIPHER with position information. Currently requires only three functions.
* gffToDataFrame - Convert standard gff3 representation of genomic data into succinct representation.
* NucleotideOverlap - Tabulate all genomic features linked by syntenic k-mers.
* PairSummaries - Summarize all linked pairs, perform pairwise alignments if desired.
